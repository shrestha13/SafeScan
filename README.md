# SafeScan
SafeScan is a Smart File Behaviour Analyzer designed to detect potentially malicious or suspicious files by analyzing file entropy, extensions, and presence of known suspicious strings. It helps users monitor folders for new files, analyze them heuristically, quarantine flagged files, and generate detailed reports in text and PDF formats.
